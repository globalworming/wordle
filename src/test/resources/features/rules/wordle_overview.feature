  The rules of Wordle are simple. Your objective is to guess a secret five-letter word in as few guesses as possible.
  To submit a guess, type any five-letter word and press enter.
  All of your guesses must be real words, according to a dictionary of five-letter words that Wordle allows as guesses.

  Example: Player guesses the right word and wins
    Players have to guess a five-letter word.
    - Correctly placed letters are shown as GREEN
    - Incorrectly placed letters are shown as YELLOW

      | B | E | A | S | T |
