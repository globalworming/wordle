# The Wordle Game

Wordle is a popular word puzzle game that tests your vocabulary and problem-solving skills. The objective of the game is to guess a hidden word by proposing different word possibilities within a specific number of tries.

The game works on a process of elimination and deduction. You start by guessing a word of a certain length, usually five letters. The game then provides feedback on each letter in your guessed word. If a letter is correct and in the right position, it will be highlighted in green. If the letter is correct but in the wrong position, it will be highlighted in yellow. If the letter is not in the word at all, it will be grayed out.

By using this feedback, players can adjust their next guesses, eliminating certain letters and focusing on others. The goal is to find the hidden word in the fewest number of guesses. It's a fun, challenging game that combines elements of crosswords and Sudoku, testing both your vocabulary and your logical thinking skills.
